# JavaScriptProject
Welcome to Aquatroplois, where users will create the aquarium of your dreams right on your device. You'll be able to select the type of your fish to add and care for. Be sure to interact with your fish by feeding and playing with them. And be sure to pay attention to those hunger bars, unless you want to see your fish floating. Don't forget to decorate your aquarium, some fish might be happier with certain types of decorations!

In addition, this project will include press the interact or feed feature to have your fish swim toward a certain direction! Drag and place your decorations of your liking to style up your dream aquarium. Most importantly enjoy the process and show your creativity.

- The Nav bar on the left will include, an interactive, feeding, animal selection, decoration selection button.
- The interactive button will send all the fish to the point that you have clicked on the aquarium.
- Fish will grow larger when fed and will have a lifespan so with age they might passaway.
- Decorations will be place within a grid location.

Technologies/Libraries/API

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- The Canvas API to render the game board
- Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
- npm to manage project dependencies

Implementation Timeline

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. I would like to have all my moving pieces to have functionality by the end of the weekend. Without any graphic design.

Monday: Will start to figure out how to create a grid that is visable to my user when placing decorations on the aquarium.

Tuesday: Start to implement movements of the fish and graphics of the fish design.

Wednesday: Finish implementing the navigation bar that would allow me to select and choose fish and decoration of my choosing.

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
