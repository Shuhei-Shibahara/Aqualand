# JavaScriptProject
Welcome to Aquatroplois, where users will create the aquarium of your dreams right on your device. You'll be able to select the type of your fish to add and care for. Be sure to interact with your fish by feeding and playing with them. And be sure to pay attention to those hunger bars, unless you want to see your fish floating. Don't forget to decorate your aquarium, some fish might be happier with certain types of decorations!

In addition, this project will include press the interact or feed feature to have your fish swim toward a certain direction! Drag and place your decorations of your liking to style up your dream aquarium. Most importantly enjoy the process and show your creativity.
